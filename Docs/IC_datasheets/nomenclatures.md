DHT22
=====

https://learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging.pdf
Don't forget to connect a 4.7K - 10K resistor from the data pin to VCC (if 4.7K doesn't work, try 10K)

Requieres: 1 GPIO pin. [Connected to any GPIO pin on the Raspi]
DHT22:
- pin 1 (left most): +3.3V = VCC
- pin 2: GPIO = data pin
- pin 3: n/a
- pin 4 (right most): GND
